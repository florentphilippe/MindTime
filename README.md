#Mind Time
A very small client inspired from the Bullet Journal that help you to manage better your time :p
Actually it's not so powerful for now, the project started recently and I'll do my best to improve it.

## Features
* Manage smarter your time by choosing a icon for your events
* Inspired a lot from the BulletJournal which make you able to manage your time easier and quickly
* Cross-platform : the program is a simple jar that can be launch on Windows, Mac OS and even linux. You just need to have installed [Java](https://www.java.com)
* Very light and fast
... And there are a lot more coming soon ;)

## Version
It is in v.1
The next step will be to allow more flexibility for the user to modify and organize his events.

## Help
If you do know java, just go on an fork the project !
I'm a very young coder, sorry for the mess in the sources and I'll be very glad if you can help me as far as you can.
